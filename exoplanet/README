data from ... well, let's see, there are a few places
	
	http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/
		is large
		produces exoplanet.eu_catalog.csv
	
	http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/
		largest
		seems most up to date
		produces planets.csv
	
going with caltech for now.

for the record there's only 1 star name in the HYG star database that is in the NASA database
but there are only 87 named stars.  there are also 100,000 other unnamed stars.  chances are i'm going to have some overlaps ...

getdata.lua <- parses the CSV database, generates files
