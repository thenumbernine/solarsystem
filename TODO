BUGS TO FIX:
- koe should use newton solver each update (based on last update, only takes a few iterations to converge), but it's not ...
- somehow I messed up the calculations, I think when I added in barycenters for planets
- remove barycenter labels / remove selectable
- point cloud viewer.  hierarchical is good for performance but bad for network.  chopping it up into a tree only took a few ms, so go back to doing that on client side.
	also, the file is big, so only download it optionally / last maybe?
- the datasets have overlaps and need to be unified ... between the hyg and the exoplanet datasets at least
	it'd be nice to also add in the sdss3 galaxy data as another point cloud ...
- same with the gaia 1-billion star map ... this might actually benefit from a hierarchical view ...

currently the solar system visualization is a mess of too many different things:
1) keplerian orbital element calcluator
	- based on various sources of incoming data:
		- partial sets of keplerian orbital elements (one set for small bodies, another set for comets/meteors)
		- position and velocity information - for planets and moons
2) time-based extrapolation 
	- via keplerian orbital elements
	- via n-body simulation (this was what the project started as ... until the JavaScript port proved it couldn't keep up with the original LuaJIT version *cough*V8*cough*
3) various visualization elements
	- gravity wells
	- surface calculations of gravitational and tidal forces
	- angles between planets (eventually a graph that shows upcoming alignments of planets)
4) small-body queryable database (500,000 small bodies)
	- TODO put keplerian orbital elements into a separate texture of 500,000 x 16 or so (i.e. 32mb of f32 data)
5) local neighborhood of stars (120,000 stars from HYG Database)
6) exoplanets (5,000 stars from Open Exoplanet Catalogue ... some overlap with HYG Database)

to remove the overlap between HYG and open exoplanets ...
- query all open exoplanet stars by name from simbad
- query all hyg stars by name from simbad
- see what overlaps?

how to unify this all ...

- hierarchical scenegraph (there, I said it)
	- from 5000 AU the solar system can be a single point
	- from 150 AU the jupiter and saturn satellite systems can be single points
	- from .25 AU the individual planets can be rendered as a single point
	- any closer and you'd better draw with a sphere
	- error metrics should be in terms of screen pixels ... 
	
	- solar system:
		- 1 px size
			- draw as a single point / draw from within the parent node's pointset
		- bigger
			- draw children:
				- planet system:
					- 1 px size
						- draw as a single point / draw from within the parent node's pointset (i haven't got this working -- currently planets are drawn individually)
					- bigger
						- draw children
							- planets:
								- 1px size
									- single point
								- bigger
									- draw children

	- but what about the small bodies ... 500,000 point sets ... same issue as large-scale structure
