stealing this right from my universe project
hoping for a quick and dirty merge of the two.

The galaxies.f32 file comes from universe/offline/datasets/simbad/points/points.f32
The galaxyNames.json file comes from universe/offline/datasets/simbad/catalog.json

Both files are produced from running convert-simbad.lua in the offline/ folder of the universe project.
