hygdata_v3.csv = CSV data from https://github.com/astronexus/HYG-Database/raw/master/hygdata_v3.csv

getdata.lua = LuaJIT script that extracts the xyz contents and store them as a binary buffer
	produces:
	stardata.f32	<- arrays per star of ...
		float x		<- ICRF/J2000 coordinates (units of parsecs)
		float y
		float z
		float vx
		float vy
		float vz
		float mag	<- absolute magnitude
		float colorIndex	<- color index
	namedStars.json	<- table of the 87 stars with proper names, and their associated (zero-based) indexes in the stardata.f32 buffer 

getstarinfo.lua = Xavante script to return information about the star

getSimbadStarInfo.lua = creates 'simbad-data.lua' which is a lua data file containing Simbad ID and OIDREF of each star

mergeWithExoplanets.lua = reads '../exoplanet/openExoplanetCatalog.json' and removes entries from this and merges them into there
							relies on 'simbad-data.lua', particularly by matching Simbad OIDREFs
