instructions:
1) getdata.lua				-- gets the pos and vel of all major bodies (planets and moons).  also records extra data of bodies to be parsed later.  
							- writes <DATE>-dynamic-vars.json.  From here you should manually go over the new file, make sure it's good, and then rename it to 'dynamic-vars.json'
2) parse.lua				-- parses mass, radius, etc variables from the recorded telnet session.  writes static-vars.json
3) get_from_ssd.lua			-- fills in the blanks that parse didn't using more reliable websites.  modifies static-vars.json
4) trim-dynamic-vars.lua	-- gets rid of entries in one set but not the other (typically in dynamic but not static)

results:
dynamic-vars.json	- list of dynamic data for each body (position and velocity) and julian timestamp
static-vars.json	- list of static data for each body.  mass, radius, eccentricity, etc.
