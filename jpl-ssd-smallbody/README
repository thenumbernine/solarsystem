1) getdata.lua	- downloads JPL SSD data for comets and asteroids.
	- generates one of three output methods: JSON, SQLite3, or Points
	  (you have to uncomment the generation methods from within the program)

2) search.lua (executed remotely via Xavante)	- queries database for planets and returns orbit parameters. (same notice: source can vary)


output_sqlite3 produces database.sqlite3, which is used by search.lua for querying small-body information

output_points produces output.f32, which is used for generating the small body point cloud

SQLite3 powered via LuaSQL (notice: it isn't too hard to reroute this to a MySQL or PostgreSQL destination)
