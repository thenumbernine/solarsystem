1) getdata.lua	- downloads JPL SSD data for comets and asteroids.
	
2) parse.lua	
	- uses row-desc.json (which is also used by the client)
	- generates the KOE of each body and produces the following files: 
		- octree.json	- loaded initially, holds a list of all valid octree node hashes
		- node-dict.csv	- queryied by search.lua server-side 
		- nodes/*.json	- holds point data at each octree node 

3) search.lua (executed remotely via Xavante)	
	- queries node-dict.csv for strings and returns which node and index within that node the matching body is found
