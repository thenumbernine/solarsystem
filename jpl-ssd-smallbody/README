1) getdata.lua	- downloads JPL SSD data for comets and asteroids.
	
2) parse.lua	
	- generates one of two output methods: Points or SQLite3
	  Currently this is set to Points.  I'm not using SQLite3 anymore.
	  You have to uncomment the generation methods from within the program.

	output_points produces octree.json, node-dict.csv, and nodes/*.json, which is used for generating the small body point cloud

3) search.lua (executed remotely via Xavante)	- queries node-dict.csv for planets and returns orbit parameters. (same notice: source can vary)
